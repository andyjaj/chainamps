Details of this software will appear in:

"New developments in the theoretical treatment of low dimensional strongly correlated systems"
A. J. A. James, R. M. Konik, P. Lecheminant, N. J. Robinson, and A. M. Tsvelik
Reports on Progress in Physics (expected late 2016/early 2017)

Very early versions of this software were used in the following:

@article{james2013understanding,
  title={Understanding the entanglement entropy and spectra of 2D quantum systems through arrays of coupled 1D chains},
  author={James, AJA and Konik, RM},
  journal={Physical Review B (Rapid Communications)},
  volume={87},
  number={24},
  pages={241103--R},
  year={2013},
  publisher={APS}
}

@article{james2015quantum,
  title={Quantum quenches in two spatial dimensions using chain array matrix product states},
  author={James, AJA and Konik, RM},
  journal={Physical Review B (Rapid Communications)},
  volume={92},
  number={16},
  pages={161111--R},
  year={2015},
  publisher={APS}
}

The software is based on ideas originally reported in:

@article{konik2009renormalization,
  title={Renormalization Group for Treating 2D Coupled Arrays of Continuum 1D Systems},
  author={Konik, Robert M and Adamov, Yury},
  journal={Physical review letters},
  volume={102},
  number={9},
  pages={097203},
  year={2009},
  publisher={APS}
}

Many of the low level sparse matrix operations are implemented by linking to Tim Davis's elegantly simple csparse (cxsparse for complex numbers) library:
